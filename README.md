> **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DOWNLOADING AI-TOOLKIT SOFTWARE:** Please note that products from both companies Google and Microsoft use a wrong system to detect potentially dangerous downloads. These products are for example the internet browsers Chrome, Internet Explorer and operating system Windows 10. **The problem is that they do not test if there is a valid digital signature** in the downloaded file but they flag all downloads which are not downloaded frequently as potentially dangerous. Software (like the AI-TOOLKIT) which is updated frequently can never collect enough downloads to remove this message. You can disable this wrong behavior e.g. in Windows 10 by **switching OFF the Windows Defender SmartScreen** (Internet Options). This is perfectly safe to do if you have an antivirus software!

# DocumentSummary
DocumentSummary can be used for creating a summary for any text document. **You can summarize simple text, PDF files containing text, HTML files, etc. The text documents can be located on your computer or even on the internet** (internet connection is needed).

DocumentSummary uses **machine learning powered language models** in the summarization process. You can train your own language model by using any text document and in any language. You can add specialized texts specific to your discipline. The model will learn specific language features which will be used for making the automatic summary.

DocumentSummary contains a Server which can be used for automating the summary extraction process. There are also several useful built-in utilities for extracting text from PDF documents and from HTML pages, for editing large text files (even several GB's), for combining several text files together, automatically annotating PDF files, etc.
Please read the built-in help for each module for more information.

**DocumentSummary** is Microsoft Windows 64bit compatible (Windows 7, 8 and 10).
